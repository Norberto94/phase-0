What does puts do?

Puts prints out the output on the console with a new line. It does not show the evaluated code.

What is an integer? What is a float?

Floats an integers are two different kinds of numerical data. A flotat has a decimal number while an integer does not.

What is the difference between float and integer division?

Integer division will exclude all decimals in the result, while a float division will not. For example; 8/5 as an integer division will return 1, instead 8.0/5 or 8/5.0 or 8.0/5.0 (float division) will return the precise result 1.6.

How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?

Integer division will round down to the nearest whole number while float division includes any result in the decimal places.

Hours in a year:

	puts 365 * 24

Minutes in a decade:

	puts 10 * 365 * 24 * 60

How does Ruby handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of numbers?

	Ruby handles arithmetical operations as intenegrs by default, but by speceifying that a given numberical value is a float it will behave just like a calculator.

What is the difference between integers and floats?

	An integer is a whole number while a float has decimals.

What is the difference between integer and float division?

	Integer division will round down the result to the nearest whole number while float division will include decimals.

What are strings? Why and when would you use them?

	Strings are a group of characters and they can be pretty much anything you want. A string is defined by quotation marks. For example, "255" is not an integer it is a string composed of three digits and Ruby cannot process in a arithmetical operation. You use strings for text.

What are local variables? Why and when would you use them?

	Local variables are defined inside a method or loop and cannot be accessed outside of where they were declared. You would use a local variable inside a method or loop that could stand on its own from the rest of the code. 

How was this challenge? Did you get a good review of some of the basics?

	It was fun to refresh some of the things I did when preparing for my initial interview with DBC. I realized that I forgot more than I thought but it came back pretty quickly as well.
