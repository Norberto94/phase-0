What is important to know when linking an external file (like a stylesheet) to an HTML file?

You have to make sure to get the relative path right.

What tricks did you use to help you with positioning? How hard was it to get the site as you wanted it?

We divided the links into two different divs with different id's and used the float command, one floating left and the other right respectively.
We struggled a bit to figure this out but not too much. 

What CSS did you use to modify the element style (like size, color, etc.)

We used many: background-color, margin, padding, text-align, widht, font-size, float, height, clear, color, and weight.

Did you modify the HTML to include classes or ids? If so, which did you choose and why? If you didn't, how would you know which one to add to your HTML?

We used both and we knew to used class instead of ID whenever we knew that we were using it multiple times.

When you compared your site to the actual code base, which do you think had cleaner code that followed best practices and why?

The actual website did not use a separate css file for formatting, and I believe the way they created the link was more cumbersome than ours.
But I guess they had a more specific way they wanted the links  to look.
