<!-- 
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
A lot of fun!
- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
We didn't need to for this assignment
- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
We did the skeleton and nothing else.
- What seems good and bad about HTML?
What seems good about HTML is the ability to build an skeleton without having to worry about aesthetics too much, so you can focus on making sure than information flows the way it is supposed to first. This same "positive" aspect of HTML could be perceived by someone else as negative.
- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
Well this is not much of a trick but it is useful to remember what the commands stand for as most of the ones I have learned so far are abbreviations of the actions they do. I also open and close the head and body before anything else.
