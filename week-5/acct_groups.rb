#What was the most interesting and most difficult part of this challenge?

#The most interesting part of this challenge was thinking from scratch without rspec as gudelines, this was also the most challenging.


#Do you feel you are improving in your ability to write pseudocode and break the problem down?

#My pseudocode for this challenge was pretty simple but I am definetely getting better. I feel that my pseudocode for the solo challenge was good.

#Was your approach for automating this task a good solution? What could have made it even better?

#It prints out in a neat way the groups with the group number on top and spacing between groups, so it does the job. It could be better if it stored the data.

#What data structure did you decide to store the accountability groups in and why?

#I used arrays because there was no real need to have each group paired with another piece of data.

#What did you learn in the process of refactoring your initial solution? Did you learn any new Ruby methods?

#My initial solution did not have the formatting of my final solution. I did not use any new Ruby methods for this challenge.
